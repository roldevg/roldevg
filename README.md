### Hi there, I'm Eugene ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a Team Lead/Lead Java Developer, and Iâ€™m currently working on fintech project at @deutschebank
  - I have over 7 years of working experience in the backend development, 3 years as a Team Lead/Solution Architect. 
  - My full CV is here: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roldukhin/)

- Experienced in scalable and fault-tolerance distributed microservices, last 5 years I'm working with distributed applications.
  - T-shaped. I need know how code gets to production and what's going on around and how to optimise it. 
You don't need to implement a lot of code if you can you some standard tools from devops toolchain, for example.
  - DevOps adept: Docker/Kubernetes, clouds: AWS/GCP, CI/CD, Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, TICK), TerraForm, Ansible
Know something new - it's most interesting part of developer job :)
- Engineering practices. So, if we need to write some code... ok. Let's use engineers practices like XP, implement enough tests 
(sometime with TDD) and stay the code the better that it was before.
Experienced in engineers practices and automation testing (integration/e2e/performance), like Selenide!
Solve incidents fast - it's most stressful part of developer job, I prefer to sleep well :)

- Business oriented. I have an Agile mindset, like to solve problems of real clients, ideally without code. 
Make a suppose and get the feedback, optimise it. 
Help to real people - it's most enjoyable part of developer job :)
